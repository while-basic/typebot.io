title: Google Sheets
---

With the Google Sheets integration step, you can inject, update or get data from Google Spreadsheets. For an overview of how it works check out this video

<div className="relative" style={{ paddingBottom: '64.5933014354067%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UjlZvlqg6mA"
    allowFullScreen
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
  />
</div>

In order to properly work, your spreadsheet must have its first row as a header row. And all header name should be unique. This is how the block knows which column to update:

    alt="Google Analytics block"
  />
</Frame>

## How to add the submission date to my row?

For this, you will need to set a new variable with the value "Now" before the Google Sheets block. Then you can simply use this variable in the Google Sheets block.

## Advanced

<div className="relative" style={{ paddingBottom: '64.5933014354067%' }}>
  <iframe

    allowFullScreen
    className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
  />
</div>

## Troubleshooting

The Google sheets block didn't insert or update a row but was supposed to? Make sure to check the [logs](/results/overview#logs). If you still can't figure out what went wrong, shoot me a message using the chat button directly in the tool üëç
